      <h2>Love in the time of Human [Tinder] Virus</h2>
      <h3>Noah = N Shayne = S</h3>
      <div class="top">
        <p>As someone who is no stranger to dating, I’ve met people in strange places. And by far the strangest is Tinder, a popular dating app amongst college kids. Currently, I have a girlfriend, but at the time I felt like I was in the minority of not liking it. I called my friend Shayne Gasser about his opinion on match-making through his phone. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="lBlock">
        <div class="lPhoto" id="photo1"></div>
        <p>
          N: Hello?<br />
          S: Howdy.<br />
          N: Hey Shayne! How are you?<br />
          S: I’m alright, I’ve doing a lot of school work and playing [Roblox].<br />
          N: (laughs) You’re still playing that?<br />
          S: Hey man, don’t make fun of [Roblox] (laughs).
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="rBlock">
        <p>N: Alright alright, and to be fair I played it quite a bit with you.<br />
          S: Exactly.<br />
          N: On a completely different note, it’s time to start the interview (laughs). <br />
          S: I’m ready when you are.<br />
          N: I recently came down to photograph you, but because of time constraints I couldn’t do interview at the time (also Shayne I’m recording this and have to give context [laughs]). You agreed, but with one condition: I take new tinder pictures for you. <br />
          S: I feel like I’m on a 1 (800) hotline, my call is being recorded for quality purposes.

      <div class="lBlock">
        <div class="lPhoto" id="photo3"></div>
        <p>N: Well, kind of. Except this time I’m not going to be able to put you on hold for 30 minutes and deflect every question.<br />
        S: You’re right, that’s my job (laughs).<br />
        N: Oh boy, this is going to be fun then. So first question, when did you start using Tinder? I know that’s your preferred online dating platform.<br />
        S: You sound very professional, maybe I am on an 1 (800) hotline. I started when I got to college, it seemed like the right time for some reason. Leaving high school I was ready for a new pool of people to meet and potentially date.
        </p>

        <p>
          N: For context, Shayne goes to Millersville University in Millersville, PA. Was there anything you noticed when first experiencing the app?<br />
          S: Well, it felt disconnected. (Pause) Sorry if I go quiet for a second, I wrote a paper last night that took up the last bit of my brain cells.<br />
          N: (Laughs) Take your time.<br />
          S: At the surface level, it’s very conceited—basing your entire judgement on a person by how attractive they are. I get it, being attracted to someone is a big reason why you would first approach them. But it feels more selfish and contrived, and it may sound misogynistic but when you know your angles you can look different compared to real life.<br />
          N: I wouldn’t call that misogynistic, I’d be willing to say it relies more on being self-conscious, but not necessarily in a bad way. <br />
          S: Oh yeah, if they know their angles more power to them. It’s important to “feel yourself”, as kids say. Now, once you get into apps like Facetune is where things get tricky.

        <div class="lPhoto" id="photo5"></div>
        <p>
          N: That’s true, when artificially changing your appearance is where the self-consciousness because bad. To quote Joe Talbot of Idles, “If someone talked to you, the way you do to you, I'd put their teeth through, love yourself”<br />
          S: Exactly, except I’m not the kind of guy to be screaming in a song (laughs).<br />
          N: Yeah you’ve always been the kind of guy to prefer a mean banjo solo (laughs).<br />
          S: Well, you know me.<br />
          N: So going off your first experience, I know you’ve continued to use it on and off. Is it because of that same reason? Did you meet someone?<br />
          S: There would be girls here and there, but funnily enough none of them came from Tinder. Tinder feels artificial socializing. I prefer talking in real life, for a plethora of reasons. Through text, you can’t really get a feel for how someone carries themself. And the general feeling of apathy that comes from it. I’m not the kind of guy to hook up, I prefer a real relationship. It’s an interesting social dynamic, it honestly feels like a completely different world when I’m on Tinder.
        </p>

      <div class="rBlock">
        <p>N: I’ve used Tinder before and I completely agree. You become so jaded after a while of things like people not responding, becoming a zombie from swiping on so many people, it really is tiring.<br />
S: Exactly, It’s not something I want to use most of the time, and I delete it and redownload it when I’m feeling especially lonely. It’s not real “mingling”, but it’s something. (Pause) And even at times it feels like I get lonelier because it, including the points I made earlier. <br />
N: So how about now? Are you using it currently? <br />
S: I am, but I’m trying to not take it as seriously. Trying to socialize more with new people, and make sure I’m surrounded by my friends rather than ignoring them and swiping.<br />
N: To close this out, would you recommend someone to use Tinder?

        <p>
        S: That’s a tough one. It depends on what you’re looking for. Obviously I have no experience in the realm of the whole “hook up culture”, but I’ve heard mixed things about that as well. If you must use it, I recommend not getting invested. It takes out some of the biggest parts of meeting new people. And of course I don’t go to art school so I’m not sure how it is over there (laughs). <br />
        N: (Laughs) It’s a little odd that’s for sure, it seems as a whole it is taken a lot less seriously. Which might be a better environment to do it. But to wrap this up, thank you for taking the time to answer a few questions and I hope you enjoy your newly revamped profile.<br />
        S: (Laughs) I’ll let you know how it goes.
